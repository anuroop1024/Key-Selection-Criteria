\section{\textit{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont Evidence of research output including publications, conference contributions and/or technical reports in the field.} }

\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont As outlined on page 2 of my curriculum vitæ, I have authored 3 articles in reputed journals, 3 book chapters and 18 conference papers with a good citation record. 

\section{\textit{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont Ability to generate alternative funding projects through effective liaison with industry and government.}}

\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont In my role as Research Fellow, I have applied for external funding from industry and government organisations. In my previous academic role, I have worked with local electronics manufacturing companies on their research projects, achieved letters of recognition for proficiently designed R&D processes.

\section{\textit{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont Ability to work autonomously whilst displaying a strong commitment to work in a team environment, including the demonstrated ability to confidently and effectively work with colleagues, project team leaders, and industry partners.}}

During my university studies and employment experience have involved working extensively in teams. My previous employment as a lecturer at Waikato Institute of Technology has involved working cooperatively in a team of nine people. This position has involved supporting team members to current teaching resources, lesson plans, learning outcomes, effective blended delivery methods and effective assessment methods etc, for electrical, electronics modules. Currently, I am involved in two inter-discipline projects that involves teams from the school of engineering \& computer science department, School of architecture and school of education. This involves regular group meetings with colleagues, project team leaders, and industry partners for research outputs, drafting and redrafting the funding applications, research documents, setting goals and creating resources. 

\section{\textit{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont Demonstrated ability to meet deadlines and effectively manage varying workloads and respond to changing priorities as required.}}



I plan my work in a structured manner, it allows me to be flexible and helps me to assess the consequences of unforeseen challenges. Managing various tasks simultaneously and bringing these to a successful conclusion is my expertise. Currently, I am employed as a full-time research fellow and also a part-time senior tutor. In these roles, I effectively managed workload by tutoring students in class and simultaneously prioritised my research outputs on time. I always make sure that I complete my duties in time and meet deadlines without fail. I am sure my references will be very complimentary in this regard.

\section{\textit{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont Demonstrated high level written and verbal communication skills.}}

As a researcher and lecturer, I always demonstrated high-level communication skills as it is necessary to execute my responsibilities effectively. For example, during my early years as a researcher, I won multiple awards for my project presentations \& talks. This involved presenting my research work at international conferences, as outlined on page 4 of my curriculum vitæ. As a lecturer in my previous role, I mentor\& confer with students from diverse nationalities and that enabled me to gain high-level verbal communications skills over the years.  Also, I have authored 3 articles in reputed journals, 3 book chapters and 18 conference papers which clearly exhibits my high-level written and verbal communication skills.
